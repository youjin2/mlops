## MLflow practices

Most of the examples are based on [Machine Learning Engineering with MLflow].


### End-to-end MLflow pipeline
See [examples/stockpred], which develops a classificiation model to detect stock market movement with MLflow.  
You can also check out the `MLflow trackinig` component which is the webserver providing visual explanations of different model runs and ML model serving examples with `mlflow models serve`.


### Machine Learning Project Process
1. Ideation: identifying a business opportunity & formulating the problem
2. Prototyping: verifying the feasibility
3. Pilot: evaluating and iterating over a ML algorithm
4. Production: run the ML project in production
